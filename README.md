# GitLab MCP Server

This repository hosts the **GitLab MCP Server**, a proof-of-concept service intended to integrate chat operations and API interactions with GitLab. The project is currently experimental and the goal is to iteratively build a lightweight backend that can eventually power ChatOps workflows and automation inside GitLab.

## Backlog Epics

Development for this project is tracked in GitLab. The current backlog is divided into the following epics:

1. **Infrastructure** – bootstrapping the server, setting up a build system, and deploying the basic environment.
2. **API Integrations** – wiring the server to existing GitLab APIs, GitHub APIs, and other integrations as needed.
3. **ChatOps** – enabling chat-based commands and responses to automate tasks in GitLab or other platforms.

These epics form the foundation of the milestone plan and will be updated over time as tasks are completed or added.

## Basic Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and install any required dependencies. At this early stage there are no strict dependencies, but this project is intended for Python development, so make sure you have Python 3.10+ available.

```bash
# Clone
git clone <repo-url>
cd mcp_gitlab_server

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install development dependencies once they are defined
# (For now there are none)
```

Future releases will include a requirements file or setup script as the server takes shape.

## Roadmap

The early roadmap focuses on establishing a minimal server and testing infrastructure. The following steps outline upcoming development:

- **Infrastructure** – set up Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines and define deployment practices.
- **API Integrations** – add modules to interact with GitLab and other services.
- **ChatOps** – integrate a chat bot framework and create simple commands for interacting with the MCP server.

As these pieces come together, the README will be updated with more detailed instructions and references to the epics in GitLab.
